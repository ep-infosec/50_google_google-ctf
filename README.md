# Google CTF

This repository lists most of the challenges used in the Google CTF since 2017, as well as most of the infrastructure that can be used to run them. **IMPORTANT** - The code in the 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020 and 2021 folders has unfixed security vulnerabilities. These are there on purpose, and running these on real production infrastructure is not safe.
