How-to:
    0. Give players only for_players.py!
    1. The code is deoptimized opt.py (sum of i**i%M up to 31337)
    2. pow is repeated mul, mul is repeated add, add is repeated inc
    3. mod is repeated sub, sub is repeated dec
    4. Just reverse the deoptimization (bonus points for modular
       exponentiation, though it's not necessary - works in under
       2 minutes without)
