Flag: HCL8{Woody_W00d_packer}
How to solve it:
	1. Open it in IDA
	2. Notice that:
		a. there are some letters pushing on the stack
		b. a call to sub_2A6B3, which is heavily obfuscated with a custom packer
		c. a call to sub_AC4C (strcmp) containing som calls to sub_AE7B (strlen)
	3. put a breakpoint on sub_AC4C, and dump the flag
