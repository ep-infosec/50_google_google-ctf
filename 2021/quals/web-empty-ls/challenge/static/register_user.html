    <p>This will download your private key and signed certificate in a single PKCS #12 file.</p>
    <p>The password is <pre>changeit</pre> . Despite what the password says, you should not change it, because it uses PKCS #12 encryption, which is weak. Instead you should use full disk encryption or something similar. If you're really smart you'll stick that sucker in a TPM.</p>
    <p>To install this cert in Chrome go to <pre>chrome://settings/certificates</pre> , click <i>Import</i>, then select the downloaded file. Enter the password <pre>changeit</pre> when prompted.</p>
    <p>This certificate expires in 1 year. Some time within the next year we will implement a way for you to exchange your cert for a new one.</p>
