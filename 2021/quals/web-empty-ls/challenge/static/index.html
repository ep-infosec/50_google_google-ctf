    Welcome to Zone443. Zone443 is a community of sites using
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_authentication#mTLS">mTLS</a>
    authentication. mTLS is much more secure than passwords, cookies, or oauth
    tokens because those are bearer tokens, while mTLS is not a bearer token.
    Bearer tokens can be stolen by the server or by MITMs, and are commonly
    accidentally put into log files and leaked by copy and pasting headers while
    debugging. mTLS is safe from all those threats.<br><br>

    Feel free to create an account, and if you're feeling particularly ambitious,
    create your own mTLS-authenticated site!<br><br>
