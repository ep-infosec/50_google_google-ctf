  # We could have
  #allowConnectTo:
  #  - otherchallenge
  # to allow the to to talk to admin.zone443.dev during internal testing.
  # This isn't really necessary though because players never need the bot to
  # talk directly to admin.zone443.dev , they need the bot to talk to their own
  # server which proxies to admin.zone443.dev .
  # Also, it would require additional modifications to make admin.zone443.dev
  # resolve to the internal LB IP instead of the external LB IP.
