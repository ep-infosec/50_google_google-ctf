  We plan to extend our cloud offering with a secure key-value store. Right now
  it is already a groundbreaking dedicated device that can store your data, but
  in the future we will provide military-grade encryption capability.
  You are one of the selected few that may test this offering in its alpha stage
  so that we can send you a quick, three hour survey afterwards.
  The login for your dedicated VM is `root:password`.
