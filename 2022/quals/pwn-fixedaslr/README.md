# FixedASLR

In this pwn challenge you have access to a bunch of .o files, a custom loader,
and a network service. The goal is to find vulnerabilities (they are rather
trivial to spot and even a bit hinted) and exploit them bypassing mitigations
and reading the flag (or running a shell, whatever works).

For a full solution see `solution.md` (spoiler warnings).
