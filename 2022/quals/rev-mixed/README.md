# Mixed

This task forces players to reverse engineer a .pyc file. Normally this
would be simple - just put the file into one of online decompilers.

This time, the Python executable is modified so that the Python opcodes
are mixed, and the players do not know the order.

I tested this task on myself - I first wrote it, then went on two-week
vacation, then test solved it. Solving took me about a work day, and
I'm sure could be faster if using some shortcuts.
