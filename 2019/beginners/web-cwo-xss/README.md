description: "Good job! You found a further credential that looks like a VPN referred to as the cWo. The organization appears very clandestine and mysterious and reminds you of the secret ruling class of hard shelled turtle-like creatures of Xenon. Funny they trust their security to a contractor outside their systems, especially one with such bad habits.  Upon further snooping you find a video feed of those \"Cauliflowers\" which look to be the dominant lifeforms and members of the cWo. Go forth and attain greater access to reach this creature!"
