<p>Welcome to the classic game
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration_(game)">Memory</a>.

<p>Rules are simple: pick an unsolved tile, then pick the matching tile.
Solve all the tiles to win!

<p>You are limited in how many guesses you can make, and in how much time
per guess. Guess well!

<p><a href="/game.html">Play</a>
