This file contains the description of how the challenge is constructed and hints
on how it should be solved.

--- To solve the task:
There are several ways to approach this. The easiest one is described below, but
it requires knowledge of how a .pyc file is constructed.
1. Analyze the code.
2. Create a new .pyc file based on the marshaled module (requires adding a magic
   value at the beginning and a timestamp; then following that with the
   marshaled object).
3. Decompile the .pyc module using any Python decompiler.
4. Analyze the code and brute the flag.

Predicted time to solve: ~15-20 minutes.

If one doesn't know the .pyc file format it's still possible to solve it going
for the long route of disassembling the code and inspecting the code object
itself. This would lengthen the task to about 45 minutes.

--- To change the flag:
1. Edit gen_checker.py and replace the flag string.
2. Run go.sh (note, you need to replace the flag here too for tests to work).
3. Distribute only silver.py file.
