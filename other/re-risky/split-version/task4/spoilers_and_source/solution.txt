This file contains the description of how the challenge is constructed and hints
on how it should be solved.

--- To solve the task:
1. Install/download a RISC-V disassembler.
2. Disassemble and analyze the code.
3. Do a simple XOR to unXOR the flag.

Predicted time to solve: 25-40 minutes.

--- To change the flag:
1. Edit gen_carbon.py and replace the flag string.
2. Run go.sh (note, you need to replace the flag here too for tests to work).
3. Distribute only carbon file.
