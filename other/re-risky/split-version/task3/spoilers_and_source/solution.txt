This file contains the description of how the challenge is constructed and hints
on how it should be solved.

--- To solve the task:
1. Analyze the code.
2. Dump the binary data and notice it's an ELF file with symbols.
3. Analyze the ELF code - it's a simple bit mixer.
4. Reverse the mixing (or bruteforce it bit-by-bit).

Predicted time to solve: 30 minutes.

--- To change the flag:
1. Edit gen_mixer.py and replace the flag string.
2. Run go.sh (note, you need to replace the flag here too for tests to work).
3. Distribute only gold.py file.
