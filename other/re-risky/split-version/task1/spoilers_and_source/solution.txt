This file contains the description of how the challenge is constructed and hints
on how it should be solved.

--- To solve the task:
1. Decompile the .pyc file using a publically available decompiler.
2. Analyze the code.
3. UnXOR the hardcoded flag.

Predicted time to solve: 5-10 minutes.

--- To change the flag:
1. Edit gen_bronze.py and replace the flag string.
2. Run go.sh (note, you need to replace the flag here too for tests to work).
3. Distribute only bronze.pyc file.
